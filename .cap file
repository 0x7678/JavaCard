# How to convert javacard applet to .cap file
When I have completed the applet in this project,I wanted to load it to a real card.Then I came across a problem - how to convert 
javacard applet to .cap file.
I searched some data from the internet. Here thanks to Stack Overflow(http://stackoverflow.com/)giving me more information.

* Eclipse http://eclipse-jcde.sourceforge.net/user-guide.htm
 I followed the user guide and I successed.
 
* JCIDE 
After building on JCIDE,JCIDE will generate a CAP file automatically.
