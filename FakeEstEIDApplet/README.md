The electronic identity(EID) card is a government-issued document for online and offline identification.This applet is different from the real card applet in the following aspects.


◾ All meaningful data on the card can be set to arbitrary values (within the size limits of the specification).


◾ All non-interesting data is static. All checks and restrictions (PIN etc) are optional and can be turned off or on by the cardholder.


◾ Cryptographic primitives can be mixed up at will, no checks of private keys vs certificates is made.


◾ Cryptographic material can be imported and exported as wanted. 


◾ No defensive measures are implemented, only a “positive path” imitation.

Note:
The applet was tested on JCIDE, see http://www.javacos.com/developmentkit.php
